# Interactive quiz

I have made this online quiz for my final exam on higher educational school in Velenje. This quiz is made with tools such as PHP, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript and some Json. 

With this quiz, we can register, add quizes, add questions, edit quizes and questions, add new admins, check scores for each quiz and for what scores we scored on all quizes.

When first user register to the quiz, it automactly becomes admin, when second user register, it becomes normal user. 

If you wan't to use quiz, download all the files, and change the connection type in database.php, so it will connect to your own datastorage. To use correct sql file choose file script3.sql

Quiz is in slovenian language, but i'm planning to translate it to english

In case of any questions, feel free to contact me.
